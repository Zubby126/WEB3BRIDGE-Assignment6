2. my mobile view ![Mobile Preview](assets/mobile-view.png)

## My Process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Used google font [figtree= font weight: 500 and 800] for my fonts

### What I learned
I learnt how to navigate around using flex and also an insight in my Media Query
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
h1 {
  display: flex;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px){
    body{
        max-width: 100vw;
        max-height: 100vh;
    }
}
```


### Continued development
- I wish to learn more on my media query, because it seems not to work in all mobile screen as wanted
- To grind more and deepen my knowledge in CSS
